### Questions

#### A web browser works by first sending a userâ€™s request to an external server that contains the requested webpage. The web browser then takes all the web page components sent by the server and re-assembles them in the correct order. It does this by processing HTML language to create the site structure and by processing CSS language to determine how the site will look. Finally, both the structure and the style elements are combined and rendered. I use the Firefox browser, and occasionally Google Chrome.

#### A markup language uses tags to define elements which a computer can recognize and then use to manipulate text. Extensible Hyper Text Markup Language, or XHTML, is a markup language designed to combine both HTML and XML languages. While it is very similar to HTML, it is much stricter in coding requirements, which takes more time to write, but also helps make it easier to maintain.
