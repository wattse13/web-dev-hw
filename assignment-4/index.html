    <hr />

    <p>I am not seaworthy.</p>
    <p>Look how the fish mistake my hair for home.</p>
    <p>I had a life, like you. I shouldn't be riding the sea.</p>
    <p>I am not seaworthy.</p>
    <p>Let me be earthbound; star fixed</p>
    <p>Mixed with sun and smacking air.</p>
    <p>Give me the smile, the magic kiss</p>
    <p>To trick little boy death of my hand.</p>
    <p>I am not seaworthy. Look how the fish mistake my hair for home.</p>
