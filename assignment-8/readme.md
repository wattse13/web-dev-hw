# Assignment 8

## Created by Eli Watts for MART 341, Sect. 50

### Questions:

*Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?*

Before starting this class, I knew nothing about HTML. I had previously taken an introduction class to JavaScript so some topics were familiar, like git-hub, version control, and text editors, but most things were completely new to me. When I first signed up for this class, I was a little worried that I would find it as difficult as I found learning JavaScript. However, I feel somewhat confident that I understood most of the topics covered so far.
One topic I found particularly interesting, and somewhat difficult, are elements like `<div> and <span>`. I like the idea of being able to section off different parts of a website in order to group similar things together, and to make styling easier to apply consistently across all parts of a website. While I find grouping elements interesting, I still struggle with using the `<style>` element to change the appearance of referenced elements. Part of this confusion may be because I am not always sure which grouping element to use, I do not know how to reference elements based on their `<div> id=””`, and I am not always sure what elements I should group together.

*Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?*

For the most part, I am looking forward to learning more about CSS. One aspect I am excited to learn about in particular is positioning. When putting together this assignment, I often felt like my solutions to formatting problems were kind of hack-y. For example, the images I used often laid over the top of other elements. To get around this problem, I used the `<br />` element to give everything adequate space. Using the `<br />` element worked, but I feel like there must be more elegant solutions to making sure everything is positioned correctly.
I am a little worried that things are going to ramp up in complexity. While I am fairly confident I understand most of what we learned, I feel like I still struggle with the `<style>` element and id/class tags.

*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.*

As with all webpages, I began with the four main document elements -- `<html>, <head>, <title>, and <body>` --, and then added the four main meta elements inside the `<head>` element. The four main document elements add basic structure to my webpages and the four main meta elements describe the content of my webpages.
