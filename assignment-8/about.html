      <p>The world of coffee can be overwhelming. There are hundreds of brewing methods, thousands of different bean varieties, and countless arguments about the best way to make a cup of coffee. Brewing devices, like espresso machines, moka pots, or French-presses, often seem complicated or hard to use.</p>
      <p>I decided to make these web pages to try and make things a little simpler. The moka pot brewing method is one of my favorite ways to make coffee. Although it may look hard to use at first, reading through the short list of instructions reveal that it is an easy device to use to make good coffee quickly, reliably, and cheaply.</p>
      <p>Will the moka pot produce the subjectively best cup coffee? Probably not, but taste is subjective and knowing many different methods to make coffee can help people discover new tastes and new possibilities.<p>
