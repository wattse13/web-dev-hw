      <h2>Lyrics to: I've Seen Footage</h2>
      <p>&#91;Intro&#93;<br />
      Get up<br />
      Beats &#39;bout waist deep<br />
      Swallowed by beats<br />
      I stay niche<br />
      I stay—<br />
      Get up<br />
      Beats &#39;bout waist deep<br />
      Swallowed by beats<br />
      I stay niche<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage<br />

      &#91;Verse 1&#93; <br />
      What&#39;s that? Can&#39;t tell<br />
      Handheld dream shot in hell<br />
      Deep space ghetto streets<br />
      Show me somethin&#39; I ain&#39;t seen before<br />
      Mystery &#39;hind that death door<br />
      Juke step electrocute the floor<br />
      What&#39;s the science of flyin&#39; that high? <br />
      Got a no-no goin&#39; one time<br />
      Creeps up behind me<br />
      Over my shoulder<br />
      Turn around, try to see, but it&#39;s nowhere<br />
      Noided, noided, static on my blindside<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage<br />

      &#91;Hook&#93; <br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />

      &#91;Verse 2&#93; <br />
      Everybody&#39;s knowin&#39; <br />
      Where ya think you&#39;re goin&#39; ain&#39;t goin&#39; nowhere<br />
      Satellite, handle that<br />
      With a lead pipe<br />
      Who captures life<br />
      Who takes what&#39;s left, who stay<br />
      On that next, already know my gillicutti, like I told you<br />
      Don&#39;t touch me<br />
      What&#39;s up with it<br />
      &#40;I stay noided&#41; Stimulation overload account for it<br />
      Desensitized by the mass amounts of shit<br />
      &#40;I&#39;ve seen&#41; I&#39;ve seen it, I&#39;ve been it<br />
      Can&#39;t delete it, feels like jail<br />
      Full moon in the klink<br />
      Shining, don&#39;t sleep<br />
      Surveillance post my bail<br />

      &#91;Hook&#93; <br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />

      &#91;Bridge 1&#93; <br />
      Get up<br />
      Beats &#39;bout waist deep<br />
      Swallowed by beats<br />
      I stay niche<br />
      I stay—<br />
      Get up<br />
      Beats &#39;bout waist deep<br />
      Swallowed by beats<br />
      I stay niche<br />
      I&#39;ve seen-<br />

      &#91;Verse 3&#93; <br />
      Armored cop open fire Glock<br />
      On some kid who stepped so<br />
      Fast was hard to grasp what even happened &#39;til you seen that head blow<br />
      Off his shoulders in slow-mo<br />
      Rewind that, it&#39;s so cold<br />
      Rewind that, it&#39;s so cold<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided<br />
      Juke step with so much boy-rude looseness seem like<br />
      No bones in him skin &#40;Noided&#41; <br />
      My jaw hit the floor, like "This real footage, gotta see that one mo&#39; &#39;gain"<br />
      &#40;I stay&#41; Ambulance hit and run over pedestrian in Brazil<br />
      Little tiger, boy soldier<br />
      Twist cap back and kill<br />

      &#91;Bridge 2&#93; <br />
      Seen crazy shit, man, crazy shit<br />
      Seen crazy shit, man, crazy shit<br />

      &#91;Hook&#93; <br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />
      I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay noided, I&#39;ve seen footage, I stay-<br />
