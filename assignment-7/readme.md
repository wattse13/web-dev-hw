# Assignment 7

## Created by Eli Watts for MART 341, Sect. 50

### Questions:

*Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.*

Divs, classes, ids, and spans all help web developers section off parts of their website. Divs are useful for blocking off large blocks of elements like headers, paragraphs, and other associated content. Divs can contain other nested divs, classes, ids, and spans. Classes are used to define groups of specific elements. Elements may have multiple class distinctions and using classes makes styling similiar elements with CSS easier. Ids use strings to add a unique identifying attribute to an element. They work similarly to classes, but provide allow web developers to identify single important elements rather than groups. Spans are similar to divs, but they create inline groups rather than block groups. Spans are useful for marking text that needs to be styled differently from surrounding text.

*What is "alt text," and why do we use it?*

Alt text is a written discription of an image. Unlike an image caption, alt text does not appear on the webpage unless there is a problem loading the image it describes, or an individual is using screen reading technologies. Alt text is used as an alternative for people who cannot see the intended image due to a slow internet connection that cannot load the image, or due to physical limitations like blindness.
