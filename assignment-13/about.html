    <span id="aboutContent"><p>I love stories. Whether they are written, visual, or interactive, stories are what keep me going in life. I made this website to display a couple attempts of mine at the art of storytelling and to practice my beginner web development skills. While most of the examples on display are visual, I usually tend to work on the written side of things.</p>

    <p>Recently, I have been more and more attracted to the world of interactive storytelling. I grew up playing video games and have, relatively recently, began dabbling in the world of game engines and game design. As much as I would like to be able to include some examples on this webpage, the truth is the games I am currently able to make are not playable. So, in the meantime I embedded a google doc on my gallery page in the hope that visitors will take the time to interact with a story I am working on.</p></span>
