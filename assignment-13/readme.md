*Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?*

Before beginning this class I knew nothing about web development. I had taken a previous class on Java script programming, which exposed me to the basics of GitHub, version control, and repositories, but the actual syntax of html and CSS were both new to me. Everything I know about html element tags, CSS selectors, and CSS elements came from this course.

*Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?*

Before taking this class, I had taken a couple visual arts classes which taught programs like photoshop or illustrator. In these classes I did learn some about color theory and fonts, but rarely in the context of web design. In this course I learned about the importance of using a more general approach to typography as certain fonts are not always available on all end user’s computers.

Using media, other than static visual images or text, was a new topic for me. Tying together seemingly unconnected elements and media types with a well-balanced color and typography design was as exciting as it was challenging. As evident by most of my websites, it is also something I am still trying to learn.

*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.*

Like most other assignments in this course, I started by creating the basic webpage structure -- `doctype`, `html`, `title`, `head`, and `body`. In the `head` section I added meta information that described my website and added two links to CSS style sheets. I made sure to link the font style sheet first as conflicts with other style elements can occur if linked after another stylesheet.

I knew I wanted the same navigation bar on all my webpages, so I started working on that next. I was able to modify the dropdown menu I made in the previous assignment to work in my final website. I kept the same `div` structure but changed a few of the links. With the meta content and navigation bar content finished, I copied the content of my first webpage and pasted it on three additional index files. Before adding more content, I added a repository for images and a repository for my stylesheets.

On the `index.html` page, I used the `<h1>` element to add my websites title, the `<img>` element to add my website’s logo, and the `<h2>` element to add my website’s logo. The `<em>` element adds some semantic structure to my site logo. I separated all my sections of content using `<div>` elements so that I could better style the individual parts later when I created my stylesheets. Creating my other webpages followed a similar process, though I used `<iframe>` elements on the gallery page so that I could also include Google Drive Documents. One Drive document cannot be edited or commented on, but visitors to my website can comment on the second Drive document I included without leaving my webpage.

Most of my time was spent trying to get my gallery webpage to look how I wanted it to look. After using plenty of `<div>` elements to group content in the `gallery.index` I started working on the `style.css` stylesheet. I used two different classes, `displayRight` and `displayLeft` to change what side of the webpage my image floated to. While I didn’t have much of a problem moving my images left and right, trying to get the text to display correctly was difficult. It wasn’t until I used the selector `img.displayLeft` that I was able to get my text to display to the right of an image, rather than filling the empty space above it. Using the `img.displayLeft/Right` selector I was also able to set my images size and margin properties. Setting the image width and height to 50% prevents the image from growing to large when an end user zooms in on my webpage. Although I’m happy that my gallery webpage reacts mostly well to being zoomed in on, there are still some odd bugs I don’t understand. For example, if I did not include extra lines of text next to my Tooth Ache picture, the image would shrink in size. I wanted to use the vertical-align style function, to vertically center each images description, but I was unable to get it to work.

I wanted to do a similar thing with my two `<iframe>` elements, but I was unable to get my text to display to the right of my second `<iframe>` object rather than filling the empty space above it. I tried using a similar `iframe.displayLeft/right` selector, but it did not work like it did for my `<img>` elements.

To keep the navigation bar in the same position when scrolling, I gave it the display property fixed. Setting the top value to 40% keeps the navigation bar more or less centered vertically on the webpage. To keep the rest of my webpage’s content from overlapping on top of my navigation bar I moved the rest of my content 300px to the left. As I had wrapped everything that wasn’t my navigation menu in the notNav `<div>` I was able to move everything at once.

I chose some rather unappealing colors for my webpage. I used the adobe color wheel to make a color palette based on my rotting strawberry picture. As the art on display is kinda gross, I thought my webpages color palette should reflect that feeling as well. The dark green contrasts of the text contrasts well with the beige background. The text in my navigation bar is a little dark when compared to the navigation bar background, but the hover function adds a light blue which makes things a little easier to read.

Finally, I reused font styles from assignment 10. I like the contrast between the sans-serif headers and the monospaced body text. The monospaced supports a typewriter feeling, which relates to the stories I included in my gallery, and also contain serif elements without compromising too much readability.
