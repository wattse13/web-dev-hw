# Assignment 5

## Created by Eli Watts for MART 341, Sect. 50

### Questions:

*How many main document head and body elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?*

The main document may have one head and one body element. The head element contains meta information about the webpage. This information is invisible to the user but can tell search engines what kind of content a webpage contains and who created that content. Unlike the head element, the elements contained within the body element are visible to the end user and contains a webpage’s content and its structure. This includes structural elements, like headers of paragraphs, semantic elements, like bolds or italics, and the actual content of the webpage, like text, images, or links.

*Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.*

Structural markup uses tags to embed information about how content will be constructed by a web browser. This can include headers, paragraphs, lists, and breaks. Structural elements can also be used by screen reading equipment to give individuals with non-existent or poor eyesight more information about how the page’s content is put together. Semantic markup uses tags to add extra meaning to specific words or phrases which allows readers to better understand a webpage’s content. This can include, bolds, italics, quotations, or underlines. Screen reading equipment can use semantic elements to place emphasis on certain words when reading pages out loud to individuals with limited eyesight.

*Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.*

I began by creating the four main document types: the document declaration, the head, the title, and the body. In the head and title sections I added meta information about the webpage I was building. This included information like my name, the title I wanted to appear on the user’s browser tab, and the character set.

After creating the basic html structure, I began to fill it with content. The recipe format made this easy as it has some obvious structure formalities: ingredients are placed in unordered lists, directions are placed in ordered lists, and any extra information can be put into paragraphs.

Once my content was structured in a logical way, I added some semantic elements to emphasize important parts. For example, the recipe makes a distinction between melted butter/chocolate and solid chocolate. To make sure the end user used the right ingredient, melted butter/chocolate, not solid butter/chocolate, I used an emphasis tag on the word melted.

Finally, I made sure my code was properly indented and I used markup comments to turn off lines of code that were not necessary for this project.
