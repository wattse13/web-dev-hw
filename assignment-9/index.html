      <p>A lot happened in the 1980’s. Like the major historical events of the decade -- the Iran-Contra scandal, a few close calls with nuclear annihilation, and the fall of the Soviet Union – colors used in design were big, flashy, and hard to ignore. Even typically dark genres, like noir or cyberpunk, were absolutely full of colorful neon lights.</p>
